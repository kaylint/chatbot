If not, please contact your merchant or online shop.Please note that not all shipments have tracking numbers or IDs.'],\n ['When will my tracking information appear?',\n  'You should see tracking events within 24-48 hours after you have received the confirmation by your merchant or online shop. The reason it takes time to see tracking events is because the first event is created once the shipment is handed to us, i.e. once the shipment has departed the fulfillment center of your merchant or online shop.'],\n ['Why is my shipment status unchanged?',\n  'For most shipments, we provide only milestone tracking which means it may take some time before a new tracking event is displayed. Your package continues to travel to its destination despite the time between the tracking events. Depending on the destination, it could also take time to arrive in the destination country due to the distance and transit time of the selected service.Your shipment might also be delayed. Delivery delays can be caused by events beyond the control of DHL, e.g. weather events, local disruptions like public holidays, customs or strikes. In the event your shipment has not arrived within 10 days after the expected delivery time, kindly contact your merchant or online shop. The merchant or online shop as our contract partner can start an investigation for lost items.Please also note that some packages only have limited tracking events in the country of origin and no tracking events in the destination country.'],\n ['Why is my tracking number or ID not working?',\n  'In case your tracking ID is not working, please contact your merchant or online shop.'],\n ['Can I track multiple tracking numbers with a single request?',\n  'Yes, you can track multiple tracking numbers with a single request.'],\n ['Who will deliver my shipment?',\n  'We partner with 220 postal providers around the world, which deliver shipments on your behalf.'],\n ['When will my shipment be delivered?',\n  'Once your shipment has been handed over to us by the merchant or online shop, delivery is based on the service selected. The merchant or online shop usually indicates the delivery time on its website.Please keep in mind that delivery times can vary depending on the product or service chosen and origin or destination relation; from 2-3 days for neighboring countries and up to 20 days for countries with long distances.Please also keep in mind that – depending on the product or service chosen – the shipment will normally be handed over to the respective local postal company in your country for final delivery to you.'],\n ['Why has my shipment not been delivered yet?',\n  'Please keep in mind that usual delivery times can vary depending on the product  or service and origin or destination relation, from 2-3 days for neighboring countries and up to 20 days for countries with long distances.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience a delay may cause. Delivery delays can be caused by e.g. weather events, customs or strikes.

Delays of up to 10 days are unfortunately possible due to e.g. weather incidents, customs or operational backlogs.'],\n ['Why is customs holding my shipment?',\n  'Shipments must be custom cleared. Customs clearance processing times differ from country to country and cannot be influenced by DHL. For some countries, duties and taxes may be due. Customs may hold your shipment because they require more information. In this case, they will contact you.'],\n ['What are the duties and taxes?',\n  'Duties and taxes are consumption taxes. Customs duties are levied on certain goods purchased abroad. Value added taxes (VAT) are usually levied in the country where the purchased goods are consumed. Duties and taxes differ per country.
