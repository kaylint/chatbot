- - How can I track my shipment?
  - You can track your shipment using our website or one of our online portals. Usually
    your merchant or online shop sends you a link to track your shipment.
- - What is a tracking number or ID?
  - A tracking number or ID is a combination of numbers and or or letters that uniquely
    identifies your shipment. The ID length may vary from 10 to 39 characters.
- - Where can I find my tracking number or ID?
  - In general, the merchant or online shop is able to provide the tracking number
    or ID. If you have ordered a product from an online shop, the confirmation email
    or shipment notification often contains the tracking number or ID. If not, please
    contact your merchant or online shop.Please note that not all shipments have tracking
    numbers or IDs.
- - When will my tracking information appear?
  - You should see tracking events within 24-48 hours after you have received the
    confirmation by your merchant or online shop. The reason it takes time to see
    tracking events is because the first event is created once the shipment is handed
    to us, i.e. once the shipment has departed the fulfillment center of your merchant
    or online shop.
- - Why is my shipment status unchanged?
  - For most shipments, we provide only milestone tracking which means it may take
    some time before a new tracking event is displayed. Your package continues to
    travel to its destination despite the time between the tracking events. Depending
    on the destination, it could also take time to arrive in the destination country
    due to the distance and transit time of the selected service.Your shipment might
    also be delayed. Delivery delays can be caused by events beyond the control of
    DHL, e.g. weather events, local disruptions like public holidays, customs or strikes.
    In the event your shipment has not arrived within 10 days after the expected delivery
    time, kindly contact your merchant or online shop. The merchant or online shop
    as our contract partner can start an investigation for lost items.Please also
    note that some packages only have limited tracking events in the country of origin
    and no tracking events in the destination country.
- - Why is my tracking number or ID not working?
  - In case your tracking ID is not working, please contact your merchant or online
    shop.
- - Can I track multiple tracking numbers with a single request?

- - Who will deliver my shipment?
  - We partner with 220 postal providers around the world, which deliver shipments
    on your behalf.
- - When will my shipment be delivered?

    indicates the delivery time on its website.Please keep in mind that delivery

    relation; from 2-3 days for neighboring countries and up to 20 days for countries
